## ACLGAE ##

This project is a testdrive app to get s2-core and acl running on the Google App Engine
Since there needs to be another datastore than grails uses per default, I have tried to integrate JPA into the plugins.

WARNING:
Especially the acl bit is quite messy, I am aware of this, I sort of changed the whole AclService to be JPA only which would not be a great idea for a publisj ;)

Since I amjust traing to get a feeling for spring security, grails plugins, JPA and GAE this is currently my best shot

Any questins or suggestions can be posted to the thread in the grails userlist on nabble

###

The base project is the ACLGAE one

It uses the two plugin projects as in place plugins.
In order to run, just run the ACLGAE project
