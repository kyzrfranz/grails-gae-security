Use channel security to configure which URLs require HTTP and which require HTTPS. 

{table}
*Property* | *Default Value* | *Meaning*
portMapper.httpPort | 8080 | HTTP port your application uses.
portMapper.httpsPort | 8443 | HTTPS port your application uses.
secureChannel.definition | none | Map of URL pattern to channel rule
{table}

Build a Map under the @secureChannel.definition@ key, where the keys are URL patterns, and the values are one of @REQUIRES_SECURE_CHANNEL@, @REQUIRES_INSECURE_CHANNEL@, or @ANY_CHANNEL@:

{code}
grails.plugins.springsecurity.secureChannel.definition = [
   '/login/**':         'REQUIRES_SECURE_CHANNEL',
   '/maps/**':          'REQUIRES_INSECURE_CHANNEL',
   '/images/login/**':  'REQUIRES_SECURE_CHANNEL'
   '/images/**':        'ANY_CHANNEL'
]
{code}

URLs are checked in order, so be sure to put more specific rules before less specific. In the preceding example, @/images/login/\*\*@ is more specific than @/images/\*\*@, so it appears first in the configuration.
