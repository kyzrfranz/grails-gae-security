The ACL plugin adds Domain Object Security support to a Grails application that uses Spring Security. It depends on the [Spring Security Core plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-core].

The core plugin and other extension plugins support restricting access to URLs via rules that include checking a user's authentication status, roles, etc. and the ACL plugin extends this by adding support for restricting access to individual domain class instances. The access can be very fine-grained and can define which actions can be taken on an object - these typically include Read, Create, Write, Delete, and Administer but you're free to define whatever actions you like.

To learn about using ACLs in Grails, you can follow [this tutorial|guide:3. Tutorial] and in addition you can download and run a complete Grails application that uses the plugin. Installing and running the application are described [here|guide:4. Sample Application].

In addition to this document, you should read the Spring Security documentation [here|http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/domain-acls.html].
